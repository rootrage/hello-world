This is my "Hello World" for Github
Git and Github are completely different, which I didn't know. Git is a platform for allowing multiple versions of the same code to be used in a "control system", Github is a place for collaboration with these versions. I also learned what a fork which is copying someone's code to modify it. A pull which is when you are done with editing the code, you can show this to the original owner. Finally a merge which is when the code is then merged back into the original code and everyone who worked is credited.
